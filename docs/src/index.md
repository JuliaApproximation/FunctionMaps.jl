# FunctionMaps

This is the documentation for [FunctionMaps](https://github.com/JuliaApproximation/FunctionMaps.jl).

## What is FunctionMaps.jl

FunctionMaps.jl is a package designed to represent scalar- and vector-valued functions. It makes it easy to make new maps from existing ones, via composition or by taking products.

To get started, have a look at the examples or browse the API.

This documentation is a work in progress.
